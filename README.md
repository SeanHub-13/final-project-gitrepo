**Discover the afterlife! But first—make sure your soul is complete.**  
_Recollect aspects of your spirit, piece by piece, as you journey through a world shaped by ancient wisdom._

**Inspired by:**  
- 🐉 Chinese Philosophy  
- 🔥 Zoroastrian Cosmology  
- 🐫 Ancient Egyptian Conceptions of the Soul

## 🏞️ The Journey

In *Spirit Search*, the soul arrives in the afterlife fragmented.  

To move forward, you must recover the essential aspects of the self:

- **Khet** – The physical form  
- **Ren** – The name and identity  
- **Sekhem** – The life force  

Each level presents a new fragment of the soul. Only once they are reunited can you ascend beyond the veil.
